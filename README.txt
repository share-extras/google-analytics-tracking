Google Analytics tracking for Alfresco Share
============================================

Author: Will Abson

This project defines a tracking module which can be used to track site usage 
data using Google Analytics.

Installation
------------

The add-on has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco
3.3 or 3.4 installation.

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the 
custom files, which can then be installed into the 'tomcat/shared/lib' folder 
of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project 
directory.

    ant clean dist-jar

The command should build a JAR file named google-analytics-tracking.jar
in the 'build/dist' directory within your project.

To deploy the add-on files into a local Tomcat instance for testing, you can 
use the hotcopy-tomcat-jar task. You will need to set the tomcat.home
property in Ant.

    ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean hotcopy-tomcat-jar
    
Once you have run this you will need to restart Tomcat so that the classpath 
resources in the JAR file are picked up.

Using the add-on
----------------

For now the tracker must be configured by overridding the web script file 
org/alfresco/components/footer.get.config.xml in the source tree, before 
building your own version of the JAR file.

In the future a custom aspect applied to the site object will provide
this data instead.
